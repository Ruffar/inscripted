## What is this? ##
This project is a web multiplayer card game based on the popular game [Inscryption](https://www.inscryption.com/).
It's not fully functional yet.

## Current State ##

Currently, the game is fully implemented on the back-end.

It is possible to create and connect to a room with another player. However, the game is not completed in the front-end, so it's impossible to finish a turn.

## Libraries Used

- Flask
- Flask SocketIO
- Numpy
